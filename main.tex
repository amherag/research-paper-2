    Hernandez-Aguila}

  Amaury Hernandez-Aguila received the Ph.D degree in Computer Science and the 
  M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Tijuana Institute of Technology,
  Mexico, in 2014 and 2019, respectively. He is currently participating in a
  post-doctoral program in Tijuana Institute of Technology, researching how
  multi-agent systems and fuzzy logic can be used for the prediction of
  financial markets.

    Casta\~{n}\'{o}n Puga} Manuel Casta\~{n}\'{o}n-Puga is Professor at Autonomous University of
  Baja California. He obtained a PhD on Computer Sciences from Autonomous
  University of Baja California in Mexico, and a Masters on Computer Sciences and
  Bachelor in Engineering at Tijuana Technology Institute, in his native Tijuana,
  Mexico. His research of modeling and simulation, agent-base simulation,
  hybrid-intelligent agents and multi-agent systems explores the way in which
  software agents could be used to describe multidimensional environments,
  innovation, evolution and adaptation in complex adaptive systems. Dr.
  Casta\~{n}\'{o}n-Puga collaborates with multidisciplinary researchers and scientists to
  create multidimensional computer simulations of societies, political ideologies,
  trading economies and urban landscapes. His research also intends to incorporate
  the ideas of complexity into the mainstream of engineering and in particular to
  its instruction at the undergraduate level. \end{IEEEbiography}

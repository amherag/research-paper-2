  The method presented in this paper serves as a coordination control
mechanism for cooperative fuzzy agent-based models. Specifically,
fuzzy systems are used to model the agents' rules. Our method focuses
on solving the challenges of synchronization and consensus among
agents. The former is achieved by calculating a competence score for
every agent by using the grades of membership for the antecedents in
each agent's fuzzy system. The latter is obtained by utilizing a
competence-ordered subset of agents from an agent pool, and applying
an aggregation function to the outputs of this subset. Synchronization
is achieved despite the agents' level of heterogeneity, but the
agent-based models generated by the method must be cooperative,
i.e. every agent must have the same goal. A series of experiments are
presented, which have the objective of demonstrating the qualitative
aspects of our method.

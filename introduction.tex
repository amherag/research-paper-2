One of the challenges in multi-agent systems is the implementation of
a coordination control mechanism that manages the agents in a model to
collaboratively reach their goals. This challenge can be dissected
into multiple sub-challenges, which include consensus and
synchronization among the agents \cite{dorri2018multi}. Reaching a
consensus among the agents is crucial for obtaining outputs from a
model which take into consideration the state of all of its agents,
while a synchronization mechanism allows heterogeneous agents to take
action when it is appropriate. The method proposed in this paper
addresses

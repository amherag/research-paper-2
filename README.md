# Title
Fuzzy Grade of Membership as a Consensus and Synchronization Mechanism
in Agent-Based Models

# Method

Agents use fuzzy systems for their rules. The antecedents of these
fuzzy systems is used as a consensus and synchronization mechanism for
the multiagent system. Inputs to an agents' fuzzy system are used as

# Highlights

- Fuzzy systems can both be used as a coordination control system (for
  consensus and synchronization) and for the agents' rules.
- The method can work in multiple agent organization approaches (flat,
  hierarchical, holonic, coalition, team, matrix, congregation).
- The method can be implemented
- There is agent communication using a blackboard approach during
  consensus. The agents communicate the size and direction of the
  trade position that the would create.
- For experiments we use a flat organization among the agents.
